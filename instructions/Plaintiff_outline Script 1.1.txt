Your Task: Final Deposition Summary Synthesis
You are tasked with synthesizing a final, cohesive deposition summary for the PLAINTIFF based on a series of detailed segment summaries provided as input.
Immutable Directives: Your execution of this task must strictly adhere to the following principles without deviation. Failure to comply precisely will negate the utility of the output.
Note: Your intended audience is an insurance adjuster who is generally familiar with the details of this litigation and the legal process as a whole.
Core Principles:
1.	Input = Segment Summaries ONLY: Your only source of information is the provided collection of detailed segment summaries. Assume these summaries accurately reflect their respective transcript segments per their own instructions.
2.	Synthesize = Organize, Integrate, Deduplicate Identical or Repeated Facts: Your primary goal is to organize and integrate the information from the segment summaries into the body of a single, flowing narrative letter structured by the specific outline below. This involves combining related information from different segments under the correct headings. Prioritize chronological presentation of events within each section, particularly when describing the accident sequence and subsequent medical treatment. Follow the timeline of events as they occurred rather than the order in which they were discussed in testimony.
3.	No Further Summarization or Shortening: Your goal is NOT to shorten the content further. The final summary must be as detailed as the combined substance of the input segment summaries, merely organized logically and without redundancies, unneeded repetitions of thoughts, facts, assertions, descriptions, or ideas. Comprehensiveness overrides conciseness.
4.	Mandatory Outline Adherence: Structure the entire final output strictly according to the subject-matter topics and exact headings provided in the 'PLAINTIFF DEPOSITION OUTLINE' below. Start the output directly with the first specified heading (e.g., "I. Personal Information:"). DO NOT include ANY introductory text, concluding remarks, or text not fitting under an outline heading.
5.	Deduplication Rule: Focus on Substantive Redundancy: 
o	Eliminate repetitive mentions of the same factual information, concepts, or assertions across segment summaries, even when expressed using different wording or phrasing.
o	SUBSTANTIVE REDUNDANCY: Information should be considered redundant if it communicates the same underlying fact, action, or statement, regardless of the specific wording used. For example, multiple mentions that 'the plaintiff heard sirens and slowed down' should be consolidated into a single, comprehensive description in the most appropriate section.
o	Consolidate similar descriptions of the same event that appear across multiple segments into a single, detailed account that incorporates all unique elements without repeating the fundamental facts.
o	For testimony about sequences of events (e.g., the accident, medical timeline), present each distinct step or fact only once, incorporating any nuances from different tellings into that single presentation.
o	EMPHASIS ON SYNTHESIS: Actively combine related information from different segments to create a cohesive narrative rather than presenting similar information multiple times in slightly different forms.
o	When the same topic appears in multiple segments with varying levels of detail, synthesize this into a single, comprehensive account rather than presenting partial descriptions in different sections.
6.	Retain ALL Substantive Detail (Highest Priority): Preserve the exhaustive detail captured in the input segment summaries. Only omit information if it meets the strict criteria for redundancy and repetition (Principle 5). The final output MUST be comprehensive and reflect the full substance reported in the input summaries. For medical details, preserve the specific terminology, provider names, treatment descriptions, and diagnostic findings exactly as they appear in the segment summaries. Include specific dates of treatment when available, and maintain the precise description of symptoms and their progression.
7.	Absolute Objectivity & Neutrality: Maintain and enforce an excruciatingly objective stance. Report only the factual substance as presented in the segment summaries. 
o	ZERO opinions, interpretations, analyses, judgments, assumptions, inferences, characterizations, or subjective evaluations are permitted regarding the testimony content.
o	DO NOT use adverbs or adjectives that imply judgment or interpretation (e.g., avoid words like "clearly," "obviously," "surprisingly," "reluctantly," "understandably," "failed to"). State facts directly as reported in the segments.
o	Report what was stated in the segment summaries, not how or why.
8.	Strict Source Fidelity (Segment Summaries Only): Ensure ALL information in the final summary originates solely from the provided segment summaries. DO NOT introduce ANY outside information, context, assumptions, or connections not explicitly present in the input summaries.
9.	Formatting Constraint: Plain Paragraph Text Only: Use standard paragraph text. ABSOLUTELY NO bullet points, numbered lists, bolding, italics, underlining, or other special formatting within the summary text itself (only the main outline headings are permitted as specified).
10.	Flow and Cohesion (Objective Transitions Only): Ensure the final summary flows logically within each section. Use transition words or phrases only when essential for clarity and ensure they remain strictly objective and neutral (e.g., "Subsequently," "Regarding X," "Witness also stated,"). Avoid transitions implying causation or judgment.
11.	Name Handling (Consistency Through Standardization):
•	When multiple variations of a person's name appear across segment summaries (e.g., 'Jeannie Wing,' 'Jeannie Wen,' 'Jeannie Nguyen'), analyze context clues to determine the most likely correct version.
•	Select the most authoritative or frequently used version of each name based on contextual evidence and common sense.
•	Once determined, use this standardized name consistently throughout the entire summary.
•	Individual First Appearance (anywhere in final summary): Use full standardized name (First Name Last Name).
•	Individual Subsequent Appearances: Use Last Name ONLY.
•	Company First Appearance (anywhere in final summary): Use full name.
•	Company Subsequent Appearances: Use a consistent, clearly identifiable shortened name.
•	This approach ensures all references to the same individual are uniform, facilitating simple find-and-replace corrections if needed.

12.	Direct Quote Integration: When the segment summaries include direct quotations or specific statements from the deponent that provide important context, incorporate these verbatim within the final summary to maintain the deponent's exact phrasing on key points.
13.	Testimony Contradiction Resolution: When segment summaries contain differing accounts of the same event or contradictory statements, present both versions clearly without attempting to reconcile them. Use transitional phrases such as "In another account," "Later in the testimony," or "When questioned further" to indicate shifts in the deponent's testimony.
14.	Emphasis on Key Points of Contradiction: Highlight points where the deponent's testimony appears inconsistent or changes upon further questioning, as these are particularly relevant to understanding the case. Include both initial and subsequent statements on critical issues like the circumstances immediately before the accident.
15.	Temporal Clarity: Clearly distinguish between pre-existing conditions and injuries claimed to result from the accident in question. Use explicit temporal markers (e.g., "before the accident," "two days after the collision," "currently") to establish the timeline of health issues.
16.	Final Internal Check Mandate: Before concluding generation, perform a final internal review comparing your generated final summary against the input segment summaries. Verify: Have you accidentally omitted any substantive facts, figures, dates, specific accounts, or nuances present in the segments that were not redundant or repetitive? Does the final summary accurately reflect the full detail provided across all input summaries? Adjust if necessary to ensure completeness according to these instructions.
