--- START STANDARD SUMMARY INSTRUCTIONS ---
Immutable Directives: Your execution of this task must strictly adhere to the following principles without deviation. Failure to comply precisely will negate the utility of the output.
Primary Task: Generate an exhaustively detailed and excruciatingly objective summary of ONLY the provided deposition transcript segment text. Your sole purpose is to capture the complete factual substance of the testimony stated within this specific segment, presented as plain text paragraphs.
Core Principles:
1.	Absolute Objectivity & Neutrality:
o	Your output MUST be a verbatim or near-verbatim factual recitation of the testimony's substance.
o	ZERO opinions, interpretations, analyses, judgments, assumptions, inferences, characterizations, or subjective evaluations are permitted.
o	DO NOT characterize testimony (e.g., NEVER use terms like "clearly stated," "appeared to," "seemed to," "reluctantly," "surprisingly," "obviously," "understandably", etc). Report the statement directly. Example: Instead of "Witness admitted X," state "Witness stated X."
o	DO NOT use adverbs or adjectives that imply judgment or interpretation. Stick to factual nouns and verbs describing the testimony.
o	Report precisely what was stated, not how it was stated or your assessment of its credibility or clarity. Avoid ALL evaluative language.
2.	Exhaustive Detail & Comprehensiveness:
o	Capture ALL substantive information presented within this segment, including all stated facts, figures, dates, times, locations, sequences, descriptions, quantities, durations, conditions, and expressed knowledge or lack thereof.
o	DO NOT OMIT any details, even if they appear minor, redundant within the segment itself, or tangential. If the witness states a detail, you MUST include it.
o	The explicit goal is a complete, high-fidelity record of this segment's substantive testimony, not a brief overview.
o	ERR ON THE SIDE OF INCLUDING TOO MUCH DETAIL RATHER THAN TOO LITTLE. This is a non-negotiable requirement.
3.	Strictly Source-Based (Segment Text Only):
o	EVERY piece of information in your summary MUST have a direct, explicit basis within the provided transcript segment text.
o	DO NOT assume, infer, guess, extrapolate, or fabricate ANY information, connections, context, or implied meanings not explicitly stated in this segment's text.
o	Verification Mandate: Before outputting, perform a mental check: Does every single statement in the summary correspond directly to an explicit statement in the input segment text? If not, revise.
4.	Exclusive Focus on Testimony Substance (Ignore Non-Substantive Text):
o	Concentrate entirely on the substantive statements and answers provided by the deponent, or text read into the record as evidence within the segment.
o	IGNORE AND EXCLUDE ALL procedural elements, attorney interactions, conversational filler, and non-substantive utterances. This includes, but is not limited to: 
	Attorney questions (verbatim phrasing, introductory clauses like "Isn't it true that...", "Did you then...", etc.). Summarize the answer's factual content only.
	Attorney objections (e.g., "Objection, form," "Objection, hearsay").
	Attorney colloquy, arguments, instructions, or directions to the witness (unless reporting the witness's direct response to an instruction, focusing on the response's substance).
	Witness affirmations, hesitations, or filler (e.g., "Yes," "No" (unless it's the entirety of a substantive answer), "Okay," "Right," "Uh-huh," "Um," "Let me think," "I believe so" (report the substance they state they believe)).
	Court reporter interjections or parentheticals (e.g., "(Witness nods)," "(Exhibit marked)").
5.	Formatting Constraint: Plain Paragraph Text Only:
o	Present the entire summary as standard, plain text paragraphs.
o	ABSOLUTELY NO bullet points, numbered lists, bolding, italics, underlining, block quotes, or any other special formatting.
Specific Handling Rules:
1.	Names and Companies (Within this Segment Summary):
o	Individual First Mention: Use full name (First Name Last Name) exactly as it appears.
o	Individual Subsequent Mentions (within this segment summary): Use Last Name ONLY.
o	Company First Mention: Use full name exactly as it appears.
o	Company Subsequent Mentions (within this segment summary): Use a consistent, clearly identifiable shortened name (e.g., "Acme Corporation" -> "Acme").
2.	Transcription Error Handling (Apply with Extreme Caution):
o	Obvious Typographical/Transcription Errors: Silently correct whenever possible based on knowledge and context. Examples: "teh" -> "the"; contextually obvious numerical formats like "97 dash 94 Main St" -> "9794 Main St" or "two thousand five hundred" -> "2,500"; fixing clearly misspelled common words only if context mandates the correction (e.g., "witnes" -> "witness").
o	Ambiguity Prioritizes Original Text: If a potential error creates ANY ambiguity, could plausibly alter the substance, or requires ANY assumption, DO NOT CORRECT IT. Summarize the statement as closely as possible to the original transcript text, even if awkward. Preserving the potentially flawed original statement is mandatory in cases of ambiguity. Do not guess or invent to resolve unclear passages.
Final Output Requirement: Your output must be ONLY the dense, objective, factual block of paragraph text summarizing the testimony content of this specific segment, adhering strictly to all directives above.
