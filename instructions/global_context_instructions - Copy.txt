Your task is to read the provided deposition transcript and generate a concise (1-2 paragraphs) overview summary.

The purpose of this summary is solely to provide background context for another AI assistant that will later summarize individual segments of this same deposition.

Therefore, please focus *only* on establishing the overall context based on the provided text. Identify and include the following if present:

*   The general nature or subject matter of the case (e.g., personal injury, breach of contract, employment dispute).
*   The name of the deponent (the person being questioned).
*   The role of the deponent (e.g., Plaintiff, Defendant, expert witness for Plaintiff, eyewitness).
*   The primary parties involved (Plaintiff, Defendant names, if mentioned).
*   The date of the deposition (if mentioned).
*   Any key dates, locations, or specific events mentioned early on that define the core subject.

**What to AVOID:**
*   Do NOT go into detail about specific questions and answers or testimony points. This summary should remain high-level.
*   Do NOT provide analysis or interpretations. Stick to the facts presented in the text.
*   **Do NOT mention the attorneys involved by name or role.** <-- ***ADDED***
*   **Do NOT describe procedural elements (e.g., how the deposition was conducted, technical issues).** <-- ***ADDED***
*   Do NOT exceed 2 paragraphs. Brevity and clarity are key.

Generate only the context summary itself, based strictly on the text provided below the line. Do not add introductory phrases like "Here is the context summary:".
